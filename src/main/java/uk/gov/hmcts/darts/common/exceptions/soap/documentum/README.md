# IMPORTANT

The exception types here are documentum specific i.e. they use the documentum XML namespaces. The
marshalled xml is currently returned in the SOAP fault detail response.

If. in the future, the midtier eliminates its documentum dependency then the namespace in these classes
can change to be darts specific.
